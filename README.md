# üõí Efficient Inventory Management using Sales Data Analytics for a Kirana Store

A capstone project for the **Business Data Management (BDM)** course, focused on solving real-world inventory problems faced by small unstructured retail stores. This project was conducted for **Bablu Kirana Store**, a local grocery shop, by collecting and analyzing real-time sales data over a 5-week period.

## üìå Problem Statement

Kirana stores often suffer from issues like:
- Overstocking and stockouts
- Inefficient order quantities
- Poor working capital utilization
- Lack of scientific forecasting and replenishment methods

The aim of this project is to apply data analytics techniques to improve inventory management, demand forecasting, and order planning.

## üìä Project Overview

- Collected and cleaned 5 weeks of daily sales data for **100 SKUs**
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis** and generated actionable insights
- Performed **ABC analysis**, **Pareto charting**, and **category-wise segmentation**
- Applied **time series forecasting** for perishables using Naive, Moving Average, and Exponential Smoothing methods
- Calculated **Safety Stock**, **Reorder Point (ROP)**, and **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**
- Recommended **optimal replenishment schedules** for efficient inventory management

## üîç Analysis Process & Methods

- **Data Collection**: Manual entry from daily observation and discussion with the shop owner  
- **Tools Used**: Excel (for Pivot Tables & Charts), Google Colab (for EDA & Forecasting)  
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed SKUs with negligible sales, handled missing values and outliers  
- **EDA**: Descriptive statistics, volume and revenue trends, category-wise sales  
- **Forecasting**: Time-series modeling for high-demand SKUs (dairy & bakery)  
- **Inventory Planning**:
  - Calculated **Safety Stock** using Z-scores and standard deviation
  - Computed **ROP** to prevent stockouts during lead time
  - Derived **EOQ** to minimize ordering and holding costs
  - Recommended replenishment frequency based on consumption rate

## üìà Key Figures & Insights

- **Volume Pareto & Revenue Pareto** charts to identify high-impact SKUs  
- **Category-wise sales trends** over weeks and days of the month  
- **Curd and milk sales forecasting** using moving average models  
- **Reorder and replenishment plans** tailored for each SKU  
- Strategic combo offer suggestions to liquidate slow-moving inventory

## üì¶ Outcomes

- Improved demand forecasting accuracy for perishables  
- Defined safety stock and reorder points to avoid stockouts  
- Optimized order quantities to minimize holding and ordering costs  
- Enabled smarter working capital management and stock rotation  
- Supported scalability by freeing up capital for new SKUs
